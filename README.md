The Media folder contains photos, videos, and a report about Pacbot V1 and our design process. The RobotFirmware folder contains ROS packages created to control the robot as well as a modified version of Harvard Robotic's Club's [open source](https://github.com/HarvardURC/Pacbot) that allowed Pacbot to communicate with the game engine server. The Simulation folder contains code pertaining to reinforcement learning-based high level path planning that will be used to train Pacbot version 2 optimal play strategy. 

The robot and everything in this repository was created in collaboration with two other members of the Tufts Robotics Club, Saurav Gyawali and Eric Wu Yufeng. Version 2 is currently in the works and should be completed in the next month or so.
