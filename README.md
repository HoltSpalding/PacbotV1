# PacbotV1

This repository contains most of the source code, photos, and videos associated with Pacbot version 1, an autonomous mobile robot designed for the [2019 Harvard Pacbot Competition](https://harvardrobotics.com/pacbots). The Harvard Pacbot Competition is an intercollegiate robotics competition which brings Pacman, the classic arcade game, to the physical world. 

I worked on this robot with two other members of the Tufts Robotics Club (Saurav Gyawali and Eric Wu Yufeng) and we managed to place 3rd in the 2019 competition!!!

The Media folder contains photos, videos, and a report about Pacbot V1 and our design process. The RobotFirmware folder contains ROS packages created to control the robot as well as a modified version of Harvard Robotic's Club's [open source](https://github.com/HarvardURC/Pacbot) that allowed Pacbot to communicate with the game engine server. The Simulation folder contains code pertaining to the reinforcement learning-based high level path planning used by Pacbot to strategically navigate the course. 

The robot and everything in this repository was created in collaboration with two other members of the Tufts Robotics Club, Saurav Gyawali and Eric Wu Yufeng. Version 2 is currently in the works.
