# Training Pacbot In Simulation

gameEngine runs Harvard's game engine to train a deep Q learning agent optimal play strategy. Remember to change the file permissions on the bash files. Run "./runsim" to run the simulator on port  11297 and run "./killsim" to kill it. 

openai-pacman-ram.py trains a DQN agent on OpenAi-gym's [MsPacman-ram-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MsPacman-ram-v0/)

Gazebo contains a gazebo 7 environment which will be used to train Pacbot V2 in simulation.

Check the requirements.txt to see how to set up your virtualenv to run all of these files.
